        <h2>Strongest Trait and Its Impact</h2>
        <p>One of my strongest traits is my Determination. This quality has a significant impact on my academic life. Once I set a goal, I pursue it with unwavering focus and perseverance. Whether I'm navigating a tough challenge or working steadily through my studies, I remain driven to see things through to completion. .</p>

        <h2>My Hero</h2>
        <p>My hero is my father, Gregory Less. As a hardworking man, he has always been someone I deeply admire. He constantly motivates me to push myself, stay disciplined, and strive to do better in everything I do. His dedication and perseverance have shown me the value of resilience and determination, both in school and in life.  
            Growing up, I have watched how he tackles challenges without giving up, and that example has shaped my own mindset. His encouragement reminds me that hard work pays off, and that I should never settle for less than my best. My fatherâ€™s guidance continues to inspire me, and he remains the person I look up to the most as I work toward building my future.

    <section id="personality-test">
        <h2>Personality Test Results</h2>
        <p> I took the Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test to learn more about  my personality type. Below is a screenshot of the test results:</p>
        <img src="../assets/personality test result.png" alt="Personality Test Results">
        <p>* The results of the test show that I'm a Guardian. The Guardian personality, according to the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, is typically characterized by
            traits such as being dependable, hardworking, and protective of others. Guardians are practical,
            organized, and committed to ensuring stability and security.
            I find that this result represents my personality in a general sense but still not capturing certain aspects it is still what i would classify myself as .
            The description of Guardians as hardworking is a aspect I relate to, especially in my academic  where i have a strong work ethic and are very
            organized and manage my time well.</p>
